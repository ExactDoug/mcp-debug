# Project overview
The ./README.md provides an overview of this project.

@README.md

## Potentially out-dated README.md contents

** IMPORTANT **
We are actively implementing new features in this project and have not updated all the docs yet.
Therefore the contents of the README.md as provided above are just for reference to provide
a good foundational understanding of the conceptual functionality of this project (or as the
project was a day or two ago).

** Double-Check **
For any work you may do, you must NOT consider the README.md contents as fully accurate,
up-to-date, or authoratative.

Double-check and verify actual state before doing any work.

You can also look at recent git commits.

And also use claude-mem tool to get an excellent understanding of recent work, developments & plans.

# Build Path

`cd /path/to/mcp-debug`  <---- replace this with actual path to the project.
(if already in the project root directory, the above command is unnecessary)

go build -o ./bin/mcp-debug .

## Build to ./bin/

Do not build/publish to ./

Only build/publish to ./bin/

(our MCP client is pointed at `./bin/mcp-debug`, so that is where you must create the build).
